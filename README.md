## Hello world programs

This section contains subsections about my main hello world programs.

### Python 3

I took 2 years of Python courses in High School from 2017 to 2019. I made a hello world program in this class, it was my first, and it was so easy, I didn't even really need instruction.

You can view it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Hello-world/blob/master/HelloWorld/Python3/Helloworld.py) or you can see the source below

1 `print ("Hello world")`

### Java 1.8

I took an AP Java class from 2018 to 2019, and of course, I made a Hello world program in this class as well. This time, I learned about the comma in the name, I originally didn't notice it.

You can view it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Hello-world/blob/master/HelloWorld/Java1.8/HelloWorld.java) or you can see the source below

01 ` `

02 `public class HelloWorld {`

03 ` `

04 `public static void main(String[] args) {`

05 `// TODO Auto-generated method stub`

06 `System.out.println("Hello, World.");`	

07 `  }`
